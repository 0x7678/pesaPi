        <h1>Contribute to PesaPI</h1>
				<p>PesaPi is an open source project, and is entirely depending on individual contributions to drive the project forward.</p>
				<p><strong>YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A DEVELOPER TO HELP WITH PESAPI !</strong></p>
				<p>We are always looking for contributions in the following areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Testing help from people using the various mobile money systems</li>
					<li>Providing information about how (new) mobile money systems work</li>
					<li>Documenting how you used PesaPI</li>
					<li>Developing new features &amp; bug-fixes</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Add support for a mobile money system</h2>
				<p>Is the mobile money system you are using not (yet) supported by PesaPI ?<br/>
					Most like this is because none of the developers has access to that mobile money system, but obviously you do - if you provide us iwth some information about how that mobile money system works then we will add support for it.<p>

					<p>Best way to get us to add support for a system is to join the mailling-list and post an mail where you answer the following questions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>What is the name of the system you want support for</li>
						<li>What telco/company offers it ? link to their website ?</li>
						<li>What country is the system in ?</li>
						<li>Briefly explain to us how the system works - kindly remember that we most likely know nothing about said system</li>
						<li>Anything you know about commercial/business accounts for the same system, and let us know if you have access to such an account</li>
						<li>If the system relies on SMS communication then include as many examples of those SMS's as you can</li>
					</ol>

					<p>If you send us this information and maybe allow us to follow up with a few more questions then it is very likely we can add support for it for you</p>

				<h2>Are you using PesaPI?</h2>
				<p>There is a great need for improved documentation on how to use PesaPi, hence it would be a GREAT help if you could document/blog about how you made it work for your application.<br/></p>

				<p>The simplest way to do it is to just write up what you did and post it in the PesaPi mailling-list, if you run a blog then you could also create a blog post about it, or you could create a youtube video screencasting how you made it work.</p>

				<p>When documenting how you made it work consider highligting the following issues:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When you did the integration</li>
					<li>How long time did it take to get it working</li>
					<li>What problems did you run into and how did you solve them</li>
					<li>Highlight any areas where you thing PesaPi could work better</li>
				</ul>
