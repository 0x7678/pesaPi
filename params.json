{"name":"Pesapi","tagline":"Mobile money middleware","body":"PesaPI\r\n=======\r\nPesaPI is an unofficial open source API for mobile money systems, released under the BSD(lite) license.  \r\nThe system currently support:\r\n* Kenya: Mpesa paybill accounts\r\n* Kenya: Mpesa private accounts\r\n* Kenya: Airtel private accounts\r\n* Kenya: Yu private accounts (experimental)\r\n* Ghana: Airtel private accounts (experimental)\r\n* Rwanda: MNT private accounts (experimental)\r\n* Tanzania: Mpesa private accounts\r\n* Tanzania: Tigo private accounts\r\n\r\nThe API supports both PUSH and PULL versions.\r\nThe PHP version of the API is generally the most mature and recomended at this point - the system is build using Mysql and Curl.\r\nPlease direct all questions to the public mailing-list \"pesaPi\" on Google-groups: http://groups.google.com/group/pesapi\r\n\r\n\r\nShort example\r\n-------------\r\nFor a short usage example please see:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/gifair\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent status\r\n--------------\r\nThe current system should be considered as beta version - at least one commercial solution is using it as its payment gateway.\r\nHowever it is not recomended that you deploy the system without having a developer available to support the setup.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1.0 was recently released and is contains a major rework of the internal structures of PesaPi - be alert that things that worked previously may not be fully working yet - as detailed testing is ongoing.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are looking for people to provide copies of the SMS messages they are getting from various payment systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem design overview\r\n----------------------\r\n* Supports both push and pull notifications.\r\n* Does synchroization between local and server database.\r\n* Transaction data are available even when main server is down.\r\n* Super easy to utilize for integrators.\r\n* Fast response on historical data.\r\n* Keep the load on servers as low as possible.\r\n* Hopefully more reliable than other APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Overview\r\n------------\r\nThe PesaPi class contains several static methods, these methods are the main interface.\r\n\r\n* availableBalance(time) -- returns the balance at a given point in time\r\n* locateByReceipt(receipt) -- returns a payment or null for the given receipt number\r\n* locateByPhone(phone, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular phone\r\n* locateByName(name, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular client name\r\n* locateByAccount(account, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular account-no\r\n* locateByTimeInterval(from, until) -- returns an array of all payments within a given time interval \r\n\r\nAs an alternative you can ask PesaPi to call a your on your site when a new transaction is received (push mechanics).\r\n\r\n\r\nWay forward\r\n-----------\r\nThe following is a highlevel \"todo\" list for the project\r\n\r\n* Getting the code to release/production quality.\r\n* Getting more developers onboard.\r\n* Add support for more payment systems.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
