MpesaPI
=======
MpesaPI is an unofficial open source API for Mpesa commercial accounts, released under the BSD(lite) license.

Current status:
---------------
The current system should be considered as a proff-of-concept, or alpha version.
The system works all the way from Safaricom to the local database - but there are still rough edges and things pending.
In any case, before using it in any production setup - you should carefully test and validate that it actually performs as you expect.
